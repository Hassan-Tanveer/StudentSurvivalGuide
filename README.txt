'Student Survival Guide' was my Final Year Project for university which was developed as a responsive web-application. The purpose behind my idea was to support students who move away from home for the first time to attend university. However, it may also be beneficial for students who still live at home and want to develop basic skills for independent living. The application aims to teach students the basics of cooking, time management and managing their finances so they are better equipped to survive for the first time away from home.
